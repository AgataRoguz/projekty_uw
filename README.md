CHARACTERS INFLUENCING POLLINATOR SHIFT
CECHY WYPŁYWAJĄCE NA ZMIANĘ ZAPYLACZA

The main goal of this project is to investigate flowers' evolution in the genus Fritillaria (Liliaceae) caused by the shift of main pollinator. majority of species which belong to this genus has insect pollinators, but there are also some bird pollinated species. The evidence indicate that the switch from entomophily to ornitophily happened at least once in the history of the genus. It is expected that the pollinator shift will be accompanied by divergence in several floral
features - morphological, phenotypical and physiological. New characters are often a response to preferences of the most common and the most effective pollinators. Flowers features in charge of bird pollination, which evolved in studied genus, can differ – the ornitophilous members of Fritillary grow in different continents and their pollinators belong to different taxonomical groups (hummingbirds vs. passerines). In this project we investigated  several characters of the flowers related to pollination biology.
